      "question": "What is a 'cipher'?",
      "answer": "It is an algorithm, or a series of well-defined steps, used to encrypt and decrypt messages."

    },
    {
      "type": "sa",
      "question": "What is the main difference in how keys are used in symmetric versus asymmetric encryption?",
      "answer": "Symmetric encryption uses one single pre-shared key to both encrypt and decrypt, while asymmetric encryption uses a pair of keys: a public key to encrypt and a different, private key to decrypt."
    },
    {
      "type": "mc",
      "question": "Which U.S. government-approved symmetric standard has a 128-bit block size and key sizes of 128, 192, or 256 bits?",

    },
    {
      "type": "sa",
      "question": "What is a major trade-off when choosing between symmetric and asymmetric encryption?",
      "answer": "Symmetric is faster and better for large amounts of data, but managing its pre-shared key is difficult. Asymmetric is slower, but it's more secure for small tasks like key exchanges because it doesn't require a pre-shared key."

    {
      "type": "sa",
      "question": "Why is 'data in use' (data in system memory) a security concern, according to the slides?",
      "answer": "Because it no longer has protection; the user needs to access and change it, which could expose sensitive data like an encryption key to criminals."

    {
      "type": "sa",
      "question": "Explain the difference between 'Physical' and 'Logical' access controls.",
      "answer": "Physical controls are actual barriers to prevent direct contact (like locks or security guards), while logical controls are hardware and software solutions (like passwords or firewalls) used to manage access to systems."

    },
    {
      "type": "sa",
      "question": "What is the difference between 'authentication' and 'authorization'?",
      "answer": "Authentication is the process of proving *who you are* (identification), while authorization is what determines *what you are allowed to do* after you have been authenticated."

    {
      "type": "sa",
      "question": "What is the main goal of data masking?",
